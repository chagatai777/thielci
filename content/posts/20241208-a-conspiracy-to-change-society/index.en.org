** Old economy biz vs new economy biz

Startups are different than existing businesses, because the existing
businesses are evaluated by the cash flows they generate for
themselves today, while for startups, they are evaluated for their
ability of generating cash flows *in the future*.

Old economy businesses, like The New York Times company of 2013, or
other newspapers, nightclubs, restaurants, etc., generate revenues
today.  They are, in a sense, already reached their peak potential in
brand recognition, market positioning, and the products they offer to
their customers.  Their peak profitability is in today and now, and
they are pretty much open to disruption and competition from the new
entrants, and thus open to losing their profits.

With tech startups, the curve is inverted: most of them will generate
big revenues not today, *but in the future* (given that they become
successful monopolies).  Therefore, their valuation has to take into
account this possible view of the future.

This is also why Twitter was valued 10x more than the New York Times
Company, back in 2013.  The investors expected Twitter to be able to
generate *monopoly profits* in 10 years, while the newspapers'
monopoly days was over.

Since most tech companies' monopoly profits will come in the next
10-15 years, the most important question to ask is: /"Is this startup
going to be around in 10 to 15 years?"/

** The road to becoming a monopoly

Most new tech companies focus on the growth and earnings in the short
term.  They become obsessed with short-term cash flow metrics and game
their operations for maximizing these metrics.

Instead of maximizing for these wrong metrics, the startup should
focus on becoming monopoly in its target market (which has a narrowly
defined scope in the founding days, yet growing its scope as the it
matures).  In order to do that, it should carry the characteristics of
monopolies in other markets that came before:

*** 1. Proprietary tech

Proprietary tech is a new and improved way of doing things.  This can
be a product that allows the novel human behavior to take place
(shopping on the net, socializing on the net, finding knowledge on the
net), or a product that improves at least 10x over the existing way of
doing things (10x cheaper and smaller electronic chips).  There is a
difference between the quality and the quantity of things, but after
some level of quantity, one may start observing changes in quality, as
well.

So, to recap, you can either: 
1. invent a new tech and keep it secret (Google)
2. improve the speed, efficiency and cost of an existing tech 10x
   (Amazon)
3. improve the visual and UX feel of a product (Apple and iPad)

A proprietary tech is something that makes your company hard to be
copied (ex: google and its search algo, back in the day).  You can
build a moat around your technology in the form of trade secrets and
patents, and protect your market turf from the simple copy-cats.  This
is the case with inventing new tech.

Of course inventing new things is more difficult than improving on the
existing things.  In that case, your startup can also decide to focus
on making its products at least 10x better in important metrics than
its incumbents.  Example: Amazon's offering 10x more books than brick
'n mortar bookstores.  Again, at some point a big advantage in
quantity can turn into an advantage in quality.
   
*** 2. Network effects

This is the property of a product and/or service to become more useful
with more people using it.  However, the pitfall here is the startup
execs becoming greedy and trying to bite more than they can chew by
wanting to target "anyone and everyone".  Such ambitions are
unrealistic at an early stage, and shows a lack of strategy for
breaking into the market.  If your product needs every one and every
computer to be on it in order to start being useful (Xanadu vs world
wide web), you are doing it wrong.

A new startup's initial network effect of its product should be aimed
at *a small niche market*.  Facebook, by targeting the Harvard
students first, did this right.  Google, by targeting the early
webpage eacosystem of the web, did this right; and it grew as the web
itself grew.  Google didn't start flat out by cataloguing any and all
the knowledge of humanity, but started with only those portions of the
human knowledge that was on the web.

*** 3. Economies of scale

Another good indicator of a monopoly business is that it gets bigger
by little to no cost.  A gym, for example, doesn't conform to this
requirement, because, a gym, given its size and the trainers it
employs, can only serve at most a limit number of customers.  In order
to grow that customer size beyond this limit, the owner has to hire
more trainers, open another branch in the city center, etc. etc.  Even
then, the gym owner's gains would be marginal, as the cost of a new
place and salaries of the new employees would eat up his earnings from
this new branch.

A software product, in contrast, is able to reach a theoretically
limitless number of customers, without having to scale the employees
at the same time, because the marginal cost of copying a software
product is zero.

*** 4. Branding

This is the most elusive one.  Because contrary to the others, there
is no easy way to measure this.  The branding is important, and the
company should own a distinct brand of itself.  As an example, Apple
is one of the most distinguished companies that gets this point right.

---

If your company and your product carry these characteristics, then you
should be aiming at creating a company that successfully generates
monopoly profits 10 years in the future.  These 4 points are good
indicators that you might have struck gold and then the job is to
actually realize the product with a *long lasting company*.  Such a
company will effectively dominate its market *for the next decade* and
will become the "*last mover*" to its market.

* Conspiracy against the outsiders
** Definite thinking vs indefinite thinking

The [[{{< ref "posts/20241122-zero-to-one" >}}#headline-4][future can be brought]] into today in a definite shape.  It can be
made to conform to our designs.  19th century building projects, such
as great dams, undersea tunnel projects, or in the 20th century, the
US intercontinental highway system were built according to this
mental attitude.

Nowadays not much people believe they can affect the incoming future.
Perhaps that's why the finance sector has grown to its size in the US:
money is the ultimate optionality in the face of a (believed to be)
indefinite and untameable future.

This indefinite understanding of the future has also affected how we
think about new businesses today.  We praise leanness, and pivoting to
new product designs in startups -- in fact, this "pivoting" (aka,
changing your mind about "the secret" that your company has set out to
exploit), has become something celebrated in startup centres in the
Universities.  "We decided to pivot our product design to satisfy this
/other/ need that we now become aware of, in the course of our work."
For the sake of "pivoting" many new startups do not flesh out their
products, nor markets, and leave them to be "decided later as we go
along".

This is wasteful.  Instead, your company should be right about its
"secret" from the outset, and pivot as little as possible.  Being
right about its secret insight, the startup should plan to bring the
material results of that insight into present by building its
production and distribution capabilities, and offering its customers
the product that comes from the future.

** Secrets that make the conspiracy

A "secret", in our context, is a piece of understanding about the
world.  This understanding has to be more or less accurate, and has to
point to a kernel of truth about the current (and near future) state
of technique and human society.  Here are some of the possible secrets
that today's successful companies may have made use of back in their
early days:

- The bulk of human knowledge will be on the internet, therefore,
  whichever company gives people a product to search the world wide
  web, will be immensely successful (Google, 1998).
- Money is essentially a way for the people that make up a society to
  communicate with each other about the production and consumption of
  commodities.  Since money is communication, and internet is
  communications en masse, it is only inevitable that monetary
  networks (payments and banking) will move to the internet (Confinity
  and X.com, before merging to form Paypal, in 1998).
- People are vain and desire superficial social connections (Facebook,
  in 2004).
- White-collared office jockeys even more so! (LinkedIn, 2003)
- Internet allows us to fulfill any consumer product order faster than
  everbody else.  It also allows us to do this practically without
  having to have any closed hours on our shop.  Facing with this
  consumers will eventually move their shopping to our online platform
  (Amazon, 1994).
- State of the art improvements in electric motor, batteries, and
  computerized power electronics are ready give the electric car a
  winning edge over the gas-guzzling automobiles.  Given a sexy
  design, people are more than ready to embrace this green,
  alternative mobility (Tesla Motors, 2003).

Each of these secrets, perhaps, was shared by other entrepreneurs as
well.  Perhaps, some sizeable portion of the society were able to see
"where the things were going" -- it was in the air.  Whatever the
case, you had to have your nose in the wind.

You will build your startup on top such a secret, a conspiracy to
change the world, by bringing a definite view of the future into the
present.  So, where do you find these secrets?  There are two sources:

1. secrets about nature
2. secrets about people

These two categories of secrets sit in-between the known and the
unknowable (ie, the mystery).  Secrets are the sources of great
companies.  Uber, Airbnb, Facebook, LinkedIn understood the secrets
about people and addressed their unaddressed needs.

To find secrets about nature, you study science.  To find secrets
about people, you start asking questions about their taboos.  What
notions are commonly accepted without deliberation?  Here's an example
"secret" that not much people knows about or considers:

#+begin_quote
Competition and capitalism are the opposites.
#+end_quote

Once you become aware of this secret, you can start building a company
with this secret understanding about the nature of competition vs
capitalism, and aim for escaping the competition.  Depending on the
accuracy of your insight into the secrets about people, you can move
yourself to the correct path (ie, the path of building a *vertically
innovating* tech startup that will be the *last mover* in its niche
market and generate *monopoly profits* in the future).

*Once you find such secrets*, you tell these secrets only to the
minimum amount of peoplpe who needs to know about them.  These small
number of people that you share this common secret with, are your
*co-founders*.  The secret is the insight about reality that allows
you to *build a unique product* around.

This is all there is to it: *a great company is a conspiracy to change
the world*, and your co-conspirators are people who share the common
secret which allows you to change the world.

** A company of co-conspirators

A startup has to have a right start.  A startup that's plagued with
interpersonal problems among its co-founders from the start is very
difficult to fix.

As a founder, your co-founders and you must get along.  You guys
should be on the same page about your understanding of the business
you are starting.  Moreover, you should understand why each one of you
wants to start this particular business (and put in 100-hour workweeks
for years).  And this understanding has to be shared among the
co-founders.

In light of this, picking a co-founder at your local University's
startup event is simply insane, only comparable to marrying someone
you met 5 minutes ago.  "Hey you too code Python?  Let's start a
startup."  How commonplace is such way of finding a co-founder?
Unfortunately, very much.  And such startups do not get anywhere.


#+begin_quote
Founders should share a prehistory before they start a company
together—otherwise they’re just rolling dice.
#+end_quote

Being a sole founder limits your ability to go from zero to one.  Your
abilities, resources and time are limited.  It is much better to pool
in these resources with 3-4 other co-founders and work towards a
common goal.

When working together with people in an institution, there can arise
some "issues of alignment".  These issues are mainly about how owns
the company, and who runs the company.  If the owners of the company
aren't the ones who running it, there can arise issues of
accountability.  It is important for the startup founders to both own
the company and also to run it.

With the employees, no startup can get on its feet with part time
employees.  All the employees has to be committed full time to the
business.  Furthermore, the colleagues should share the same office
space, with no remote workers, day in and day out.  All of these are
essential for instilling a sense of common, *shared struggle* among
the founders and employees.

Founders in early stage startups shouldn't get high yearly salaries.
In practical terms, this number shouldn't exceed 150k USD.  Anymore
than that, the founders will start politicking about keeping their
high salaries, rather than focusing completely on fixing the business
operation problems, or developing a disruptive product.  In addition
to that, giving the founders equity on company motivates them further
and aligns the founders' monetary incentives with the company's future
success.

Attracting employees.

Do not focus on benefits and paycheck.  If all it takes an employee to
leave your company to join another one is a snack bar by the water
cooler, then let him go.  Same for the salaries.  Instead of these,
the employee should be motivated by the mission statement of the
company and developing products that make the mission a success.

* Bubble avoidance checklist

Bubbles in tech industries occur.  One such example was the clean tech
bubble of the early 2000s.  Apparently everyone was starting a new
solar panel production, installation and systems startup back in the
day, expecting the green energy to be the new "internet".  However,
for someone who knows where to look, the signs of a bubble was
apparent.  Here are the questions that Peter Thiel used to judge (and
foresee the bust of) the clean tech startups of early 2000s:

1. *The Engineering Question:* Can you create breakthrough technology
   instead of incremental improvements?
2. *The Timing Question:* Is now the right time to start your
   particular business?
3. *The Monopoly Question:* Are you starting with a big share of a
   small market? (you should be able to avoid the trap of exaggerating
   your own uniqueness)
4. *The People Question:* Do you have the right team?
5. *The Distribution Question:* Do you have a way to not just create
   but deliver your product?
6. *The Durability Question:* Will your market position be defensible
   10 and 20 years into the future?
7. *The Secret Question:* Have you identified a unique opportunity
   that others don’t see?

* Conclusion
