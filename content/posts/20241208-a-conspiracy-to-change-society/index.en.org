** Old economy biz vs new economy biz

Startups are different than existing businesses, because the existing
businesses are evaluated by the cash flows they generate for
themselves today, while for startups, they are evaluated for their
ability of generating cash flows *in the future*.

Old economy businesses, like The New York Times company of 2013, or
other newspapers, nightclubs, restaurants, etc., generate revenues
today.  They are, in a sense, already reached their peak potential in
brand recognition, market positioning, and the products they offer to
their customers.  Their peak profitability is in today and now, and
they are pretty much open to disruption and competition from the new
entrants, and thus open to losing their profits.

With tech startups, the curve is inverted: most of them will generate
big revenues not today, *but in the future* (given that they become
successful monopolies).  Therefore, their valuation has to take into
account this possible view of the future.

This is also why Twitter was valued 10x more than the New York Times
Company, back in 2013.  The investors expected Twitter to be able to
generate *monopoly profits* in 10 years, while the newspapers'
monopoly days was over.

Since most tech companies' monopoly profits will come in the next
10-15 years, the most important question to ask is: /"Is this startup
going to be around in 10 to 15 years?"/

** The road to becoming a monopoly

Most new tech companies focus on the growth and earnings in the short
term.  They become obsessed with short-term cash flow metrics and game
their operations for maximizing these metrics.

Instead of maximizing for these wrong metrics, the startup should
focus on becoming monopoly in its target market (which has a narrowly
defined scope in the founding days, yet growing its scope as the it
matures).  In order to do that, it should carry the characteristics of
monopolies in other markets that came before:

*** 1. Proprietary tech

Proprietary tech is a new and improved way of doing things.  This can
be a product that allows the novel human behavior to take place
(shopping on the net, socializing on the net, finding knowledge on the
net), or a product that improves at least 10x over the existing way of
doing things (10x cheaper and smaller electronic chips).  There is a
difference between the quality and the quantity of things, but after
some level of quantity, one may start observing changes in quality, as
well.

So, to recap, you can either: 
1. invent a new tech and keep it secret (Google)
2. improve the speed, efficiency and cost of an existing tech 10x
   (Amazon)
3. improve the visual and UX feel of a product (Apple and iPad)

A proprietary tech is something that makes your company hard to be
copied (ex: google and its search algo, back in the day).  You can
build a moat around your technology in the form of trade secrets and
patents, and protect your market turf from the simple copy-cats.  This
is the case with inventing new tech.

Of course inventing new things is more difficult than improving on the
existing things.  In that case, your startup can also decide to focus
on making its products at least 10x better in important metrics than
its incumbents.  Example: Amazon's offering 10x more books than brick
'n mortar bookstores.  Again, at some point a big advantage in
quantity can turn into an advantage in quality.
   
*** 2. Network effects

This is the property of a product and/or service to become more useful
with more people using it.  However, the pitfall here is the startup
execs becoming greedy and trying to bite more than they can chew by
wanting to target "anyone and everyone".  Such ambitions are
unrealistic at an early stage, and shows a lack of strategy for
breaking into the market.  If your product needs every one and every
computer to be on it in order to start being useful (Xanadu vs world
wide web), you are doing it wrong.

A new startup's initial network effect of its product should be aimed
at *a small niche market*.  Facebook, by targeting the Harvard
students first, did this right.  Google, by targeting the early
webpage eacosystem of the web, did this right; and it grew as the web
itself grew.  Google didn't start flat out by cataloguing any and all
the knowledge of humanity, but started with only those portions of the
human knowledge that was on the web.

*** 3. Economies of scale

Another good indicator of a monopoly business is that it gets bigger
by little to no cost.  A gym, for example, doesn't conform to this
requirement, because, a gym, given its size and the trainers it
employs, can only serve at most a limit number of customers.  In order
to grow that customer size beyond this limit, the owner has to hire
more trainers, open another branch in the city center, etc. etc.  Even
then, the gym owner's gains would be marginal, as the cost of a new
place and salaries of the new employees would eat up his earnings from
this new branch.

A software product, in contrast, is able to reach a theoretically
limitless number of customers, without having to scale the employees
at the same time, because the marginal cost of copying a software
product is zero.

*** 4. Branding

This is the most elusive one.  Because contrary to the others, there
is no easy way to measure this.  The branding is important, and the
company should own a distinct brand of itself.  As an example, Apple
is one of the most distinguished companies that gets this point right.

---

If your company and your product carry these characteristics, then you
should be aiming at creating a company that successfully generates
monopoly profits 10 years in the future.  These 4 points are good
indicators that you might have struck gold and then the job is to
actually realize the product with a *long lasting company*.  Such a
company will effectively dominate its market *for the next decade* and
will become the "*last mover*" to its market.
