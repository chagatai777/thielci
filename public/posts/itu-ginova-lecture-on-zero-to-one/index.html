Why this talk?
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
I couldn&#39;t find others who shared these ideas.  Of all the startup
ideas I&#39;ve seen, and of all the young people I&#39;ve talked to for the
purposes of doing a startup project, I couldn&#39;t find people that
was interested in the similar &#34;culture&#34; or understanding of what
should constitute a startup idea.</p>
<p>
Before attending the ginova course, I had read Peter Thiel&#39;s book
zero to one.  Also, I was aware of the calibre of the startup ideas
that come out and have come out of the YCombinator, the Silicon
Valley, etc.  Google, Paypal, Twitter, Facebook, OpenAI, Neuralink,
etc. all operate on a very different understanding of technology
and human society, tech startups and profits, and the goals,
etc. – I see no such inner understanding around here.</p>
<p>
The problem is we are solely copying what we see from the outside
of these examples: just start the next social media platform, just
code the next killer app, just make the next chatgpt wrapper app…
But all of these miss out the critical component of the whole
process – that, the mindset and the goals of their founders.</p>
<p>
In this talk, I will briefly introduce some of the ideas from Peter
Thiel&#39;s Zero to One, as I believe, he honestly puts forth the inner
motivations of the founders of one such startup and the things he
had learned from executing it, PayPal.</p>

Zero to One
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Well, famously, Peter Thiel says, &#34;The next Zuckerberg won&#39;t start
a social media site; the next Bill Gates won&#39;t start a desktop OS
company.  If you are simply copying from them, you aren&#39;t learning
from them.&#34;</p>
<p>
This is quite prescient, because most of the time, all we see
around us are young wannabe startup founders directly copying what
they saw from figures such as these.  &#34;If only I act like them,
repeat their actions and their steps, surely I will be reaching
somewhere someplace&#34;.  This is cargo cult understanding of a
startup success, and a very simple example of monkey see monkey do.</p>
<p>
Instead of simply copying the visible forms of their actions, we
should understand their thought processes that had led them to
these actions that we have observed in their startup careers.</p>
<p>
So, here are a few of the points that went into the Peter Thiel&#39;s
actions, and the actions of other society-changing calibre silicon
valley startups:</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-3">
Going zero to one is more important than going one to many
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Zero to one, in this context, is using new advances in science
and technology to introduce a technological product that enables
a new mode of human action, that allows its users to reach their
goals faster, cheaper and more efficiently.</p>
<p>
Going zero to many is distributing the wealth created with going
from zero to one.  It is mainly logistics.</p>
<p>
Going zero to one is inventing the iphone.  Going one to many is
distributing the iphone to the south east asian market.  Going
zero to one is starting facebook.  Going one to many is facebook
reaching 1 billion users, OR, starting another social media with
a narrow, niche differentiator.  Going zero to one is getting
the first electric car company with a product that looks and
performs better than a golf-cart.  Going one to many is copying
that model in the Chinese market and selling it to the European.</p>
<p>
In all these cases, the vertical movement of zero to one is the
source of wealth that we as a society get to enjoy.  Without
first someone coming up with iphone, nobody has an iphone or its
competitor to buy.  The vertical movement is what brings new
forms of products into existence.  This is how human behavior
changes going from the past to the future generations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-4">
Startups are the only form of human organization scheme that can achieve this vertical movement
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Simply put, small groups of people bound together by a sense of
mission is what an early stage startup is.  This is the form of
organization that&#39;s brought forth the now gigantic internet
companies, social media companies, space exploration companies,
AI companies, crypto currency companies, etc.</p>
<p>
Big and entrenched corpos are too busy with protecting their
market share in the existing markets.  They are also burdened
with excessive bureaucracy and paper-work that stifles much of
the needed exploratory attempts at new products using new
techniques.</p>
<p>
Government organizations are too big, unfocused, nepotistic and
lacking the financial constraint that moves people to strive for
success.  If you know that you next paycheck will arrive
regardless of your work, then you don&#39;t have the sense of
urgency for what you do.</p>
<p>
Only in startup environments, which consist of young, hungry
people who are closely familiar with the newest technologies can
a truly disruptive startup doing the vertical movement arise.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-5">
Startups should aim for markets in which they can establish themselves as the monopoly
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Competition eats away the profits and causes the firms to be brutal in
how they treat their employees.  Dwindling profit margins cause a firm
to get their workers work overtimes and at minimum wage amounts.  A
company in a competitive market cannot lift its gaze form day to day
survival to the long term business planning.</p>
<p>
In contrast, Monopoly profits are what allows companies to pay higher
wages to their employees, allow more flexible work hours, and also get
the company to plan for the years ahead.  This such a leeway allows
companies to innovate new technologies.  Due to the monopoly position
Google has had enjoyed so far, it was able to drop necessary money
into researching and developing the android platform, its phone
models, its AI program (Alpha-Go, etc.), and its self-driving car
program (Waymo).  Such R&amp;D programs allow Google (and other companies
that enjoy monopoly profits) to continue creating new technologies and
make the zero to one vertical movement with new products, and
ultimately increasing the wealth and prosperity that we all eventuall
get to enjoy.  A company that has cut-throat profit margins is in no
way to have resources required for R&amp;D activities let alone the zero
to one movement.</p>
<p>
In addition to these, another reason for why a startup should aim for
becoming a monopoly in its own market, is that, the venture capital is
only interested in 100x returns (and if possible, 1000x returns).  No
VC is hungry for financing the next Indian Restaurant in the city
center, nor financing the next dry cleaner operation.  This is because
in such enterprises, the growth potential is quite small, their
markets are already fractured into thousand pieces amongst thousand
different establishments competing over the same market.  VC&#39;s are
only interested in investing in startups if they have the potential to
100x their investment.  And that is only possible for startups that
have the potential to reach monopoly status in their markets.</p>
<p>
Lastly, on a more personal note, I find faux startups who have
regurgitated mission statements and products that we have seen
countless times before, simply boring.  The next &#34;killer app&#34;, or the
next twitter-clone, or the next airbnb clone – I don&#39;t find such
endeavors worthy of my 100 hour work-week attention.  As you start a
startup, it will become your life, you won&#39;t have a thing as work-life
balance.  So, wouldn&#39;t it make sense that the work in that startup
should be something new, original, strikingly dissimilar to most of
the stuff that you&#39;d seen?  If all you are going to do is get your
&#34;startup&#34; to do some R&amp;D work for an established banking corporation&#39;s
artificial intelligence arm, why not enter that corporation as a
white-collar worker?</p>

Conclusion
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
As new startup founders, we shouldn&#39;t merely copy the visible
portion of the successful entrepreneurs&#39; actions; but also
understand how they think, and apply their thinking to our own
particular situation in our locale.  Applying startup founding
methods (like pivoting, or filling out various &#34;canvasses&#34;) without
understanding what made these methods to spring up in the first
place, is no different than acting a cargo-cult and expecting
magical results.</p>
<p>
Vertical movement of progress (that is, going &#34;zero to one&#34;) is
more important than the horizontal movement of progress (that is,
going &#34;one to many&#34;).  The vertical movement is the products and
services that make use of new technologies.  The horizontal
movement is the business of making the production and distribution
of these technologies faster and cheaper – it is logistics (or,
globalization).</p>
<p>
Startups should concern themselves with the vertical movement of
progress.  Startups are the only human organization form that can
achieve this vertical movement of progress.</p>
<p>
The biggest motivator for the founders and the venture capital
firms alike, in their interest in the startups, is the monopoly
profits.  Only if there are monopoly profits to be gained, the busy
and heavy workload of a startup environment justify itself.  Only
if there are monopoly profits to be gained, then the venture
capital investment into the startups redeem itself.</p>
<p>
Lastly, I started my talk with the complaint that I couldn&#39;t find
other young co-founders sharing these visions with me.  Well, in
order to alleviate this situation, I have started a discussion
group on the book Zero to One.  We are a small group, and we have
had our first meeting last week.  We discussed the book&#39;s first 4
chapters, containing the ideas that I have briefly presented to
you.  We are looking for interested people to join us.  We will be
reading other books that get you grasp why you do what you, or why
you should be doing what you are not yet doing.  These books are
the books such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Innovator&#39;s Dilemma, by Clayton Christensen</li>
<li>Crossing The Chasm, by Geoffrey Moore</li>
<li>Behind The Cloud, by Mark Benioff</li>
</ol>
